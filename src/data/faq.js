    question: 'What is sugaring?',
    answer: `Sugaring is a natural method of hair removal that has been practiced for centuries. 
    It involves using a mixture of sugar, water, and lemon juice to create a paste that is applied 
    against the direction of hair growth and removed in the direction of growth. This technique is 
    a popular alternative to waxing and shaving, particularly for those with sensitive skin. One 
    of the benefits of sugaring is that the sugar paste is used at body temperature, eliminating 
    the risk of burns that can occur with hot wax. Moreover, the paste does not stick to live skin 
    cells, making it safe to repeat the process several times without causing any damage to the client's skin.`

    question: 'How long does the hair need to be for my first sugaring appointment?',
    answer: `To ensure a successful sugaring appointment, it is important to have the hair at the optimal 
    length. For first-time clients who have been shaving, it is recommended to have at least two weeks of hair 
    growth. This allows the sugar paste to adhere to the hair more effectively. However, if the hair growth is 
    too long, the aesthetician may need to trim it to the appropriate length for sugaring. This ensures that the 
    hair is not too short, making it difficult for the paste to grip, or too long, which can be uncomfortable for 
    the client during the removal process.`

    question: 'How long will it take for my hair to grow back?',
    answer: `After your first sugaring session, the hair follicle will gradually deplete, which means that the hair 
    will grow back finer and sparser over time. Typically, clients can expect hair regrowth to occur between 3 to 6 weeks 
    after sugaring, depending on their individual hair growth patterns. It is important to note that with each successive 
    sugaring treatment, the hair growth will become less frequent, and the hair will become thinner and weaker. `

    question: 'Is sugaring sanitary?',
    answer: `Sugaring is a highly sanitary hair removal method, and there are several reasons why. Firstly, only a single ball 
    of sugar is used throughout the entire treatment, which eliminates the risk of double dipping and cross-contamination. Once 
    the sugar ball is used and is no longer efective, it is disposed of, and a new ball of sugar is used for the next area of the body. 
    Secondly, during the sugaring process, the sugar paste picks up dead skin cells and hair, leaving the skin smooth and clean. 
    This further reduces the risk of cross-contamination and ensures that the treatment area remains hygienic throughout the 
    entire process. Moreover, to maintain a high level of sanitation, your esthetician wears gloves for every service. This adds 
    an extra layer of protection against any potential bacteria or germs.`

    question: 'Should I exfoliate before my appointment?',
    answer: `Preparing your skin before a sugaring appointment can help to improve the results and ensure a more comfortable experience. Gently exfoliating your skin a day or two before your appointment is recommended to remove any dead skin cells and ensure that the hair is ready for removal. However, it is important to avoid using harsh scrubs or exfoliants on the day of your appointment, as this can irritate the skin and make it more sensitive. 
    A washcloth or a gentle scrub is ideal for exfoliating your skin before sugaring, but be careful not to scrub too hard. It is also important to avoid using any products that contain retinol or retin-A for at least two weeks before your appointment, as these can make your skin more sensitive and prone to irritation. 
    If you are taking any prescription drugs that affect your skin, it is important to consult with your healthcare professional before scheduling a sugaring appointment. This includes medications like Accutane, which should not be used up to 45 days before a sugaring session.
