      'LOVEEEEEE Anna. She serviced both my husband and myself for almost three years. She does her best to make sure you’re as comfortable as possible. Checks your temperature upon arrival and provides hand sanitizer. She’s a great esthetician and friend, 10/10 recommend'

      'Anna was great! It was my first time and Anna made it super easy. It was painful but she made me feel comfortable and talked me through the process. Definitely hurts but I made a second appointment. I will definitely go back again!'
